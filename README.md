## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

I learned to setup a simple HTML Form with custom validation message and style.

### Continued development

Because the background image and the pattern graphic is decorative elements and don't provide to the content of the page, I should move them from the HTML file to the CSS inorder to have a more cleaner markup.
